# ChatGPT Remix

This is a Remix Stack focused on creating a ChatGPT conversations interface. It supports multiple users, response streaming, multiple conversations, and a database (persistent) message history. It was based off the [Remix Indie Stack](https://github.com/remix-run/indie-stack), so it is has everything you need to get you started exploring.

Learn more about [Remix Stacks](https://remix.run/stacks).

## Motivation

I created this project because I could not find complete examples on how to use both Remix and the ChatGPT API with streaming and persistent conversation history, without getting overly complex. The idea is for this to be something anyone can run on their machine and not need to spin up Redis, Postgres, Docker, etc. I know a lot of people want to learn about this topic, so I hope this helps some of you get up and running faster.

This will be an evolving project to which I will add new features, better styling, etc. So if you're interested, hop on for the ride!

## What's in the stack

- Integration with [OpenAI's Chat completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat)
- Production-ready [SQLite Database](https://sqlite.org)
- Email/Password Authentication with [cookie-based sessions](https://remix.run/utils/sessions#md-createcookiesessionstorage)
- Database ORM with [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- Styling with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Code formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- Static Types with [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)

There's a lot more included (cypress, vitest, eslint, etc.) from the original stack, but I don't mention it above because I haven't configured them for this project yet. See the roadmap.

## Screenshots

Here are a few screenshots of what it looks like right now:

## Development

- Get a free API key at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

- Initialize the project

  ```sh
  npx remix init
  ```

- Initial setup: _If you just generated this project, this step has been done for you._

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```

- Add your API Key as an environment variable

  ```sh
  export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

The database seed script creates a new user with some data you can use to get started:

- Email: `test@account.com`
- Password: `1q2w3e4r`

### Relevant code:

This is a basic implementation of a ChatGPT conversations interface, but it's a good example of how you can build a full stack app with Prisma and Remix. The main functionality is creating users, logging in and out, and creating and deleting conversations that interact with the ChatGPT API.

- creating users, and logging in and out [./app/models/user.server.ts](./app/models/user.server.ts)
- user sessions, and verifying them [./app/session.server.ts](./app/session.server.ts)
- creating, and deleting conversations [./app/models/conversation.server.ts](./app/models/conversation.server.ts)
- creating, and deleting messages [./app/models/message.server.ts](./app/models/message.server.ts)
- show messages inside a conversation and create new messages [./app/conversations/conversationId.tsx](./app/conversations/conversationId.tsx)
- interact with the ChatGPT API [./app/routes/completion.tsx](./app/routes/completion.tsx)

## Roadmap

- [x] Integrate streaming responses from the ChatGPT API
- [x] Keep persistent message history for each user and conversation in the database
- [ ] Styling enhancements
- [ ] Add support for AWS DynamoDB database and AWS hosting
- [ ] Add support for Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects/KV
- [ ] Include unit tests

### Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete. To run type checking across the whole project, run `npm run typecheck`.

### Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project. It's recommended to install an editor plugin (like the [VSCode Prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)) to get auto-formatting on save. There's also a `npm run format` script you can run to format all files in the project.
